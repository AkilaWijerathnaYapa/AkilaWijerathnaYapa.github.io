As an interdisciplinary biotechnology scientist, I proudly hold the esteemed title of Fellow of the UK Higher Education Academy (HEA) Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF). With a rich background spanning Agricultural Biotechnology, Molecular Biology, Biochemistry, and Multi-Omics (including Proteomics, Metabolomics, and Transcriptomics), along with expertise in Design and Analysis of Experiments and Statistical Data Analysis, my contributions to the field are multifaceted.

Beyond the confines of traditional research and development, I am a catalyst for positive change, an innovator, and a voracious learner with diverse interests across applied biotechnology. My fervor lies in leveraging Biotechnology applications to propel R&D forward, particularly in the realms of biosecurity and the intersection of science and management.

Demonstrating adaptability through a track record of success across various roles in biotech and life sciences research, I specialize in fostering R&D infrastructures that empower organizations to unlock their full potential, aligning their efforts with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and fostering innovation.

I eagerly anticipate engaging in multidisciplinary research collaborations where I can contribute as an inventive and resourceful scientist. Moreover, I am deeply committed to championing the effective integration of science into policy directives and management strategies, ensuring readiness to meet the evolving needs of our global community.
