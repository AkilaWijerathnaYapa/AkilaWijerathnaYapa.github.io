I am an associate fellow of the UK Higher Education Academy (HEA) Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF).

I am an interdisciplinary researcher. My academic background is in agriculture, and plant biotechnology has imbued me with interest in the intersection of science and management. I am interested in applications of Omics biology to advance Crop Biotechnology with interests in plant biosecurity.

I firmly believe that the productivity of future agriculture lies in developing our understanding of adaptation and mitigation measures with climate change, sustainable management of water, land, soil, and other natural resources, including the protection of biodiversity.

I look forward to multidisciplinary research collaboration where I can be an innovative and resourceful research scientist. Further, I am passionate about working on the effective inclusion of science into policy directives and management to optimize plant production and meet the needs of a future world.
