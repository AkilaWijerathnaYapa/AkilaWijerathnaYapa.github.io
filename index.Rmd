I am an interdisciplinary researcher and a fellow of the UK Higher Education Academy (HEA) Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF).

My research background is in Agricultural Biotechnology, Molecular Plant Physiology, Biochemistry, Omics (Proteomics, Metabolomics, Transcriptomics), and Statistical data analysis. I specialize in the physiology of plant production in Controlled Environment Agriculture and Molecular Plant Physiology.

My role as a researcher is beyond research and development. I am an enabler of positive change, an innovator, and a quick learner with a broad range of interests in applied biotechnology. I am passionate about applications of Biotechnology for the advancement of Agricultural production with an interest in biosecurity and in the intersection of science and management.

I have proven my adaptability through successes in a wide range of roles in the biotech field and life sciences research. I help to develop the R&D infrastructure that enables organizations to develop their full potential and capabilities, so they can achieve UN SDGs within to develop innovations. 

I firmly believe that the productivity of future agriculture lies in developing our understanding of adaptation and mitigation measures with climate change, sustainable management of water, land, soil, and other natural resources, including the protection of biodiversity.

I look forward to multidisciplinary research collaboration where I can be an innovative and resourceful research scientist. Further, I am passionate about working on the effective inclusion of science into policy directives and management to optimize plant production and meet the needs of a future world.
