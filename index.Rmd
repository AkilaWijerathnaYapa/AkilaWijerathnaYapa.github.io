I am an associate fellow of the UK Higher Education Academy (HEA) Professional Standards Framework (UKPSF).

I am passionate about applications of Omics biology for advancement of Crop Biotechnology with interests in plant bio-security.

My academic background is in agriculture and plant biotechnology has imbued me with interest in the intersection of science and management. I strongly believe that the productivity of future agriculture lies in developing our understanding of adaptation and mitigation measures in relation to climate change, sustainable management of water, land, soil and other natural resources, including the protection of biodiversity. I would like to pursue a career where I could work on the effective inclusion of science into policy directives and management. I want to be an innovative and resourceful bio-technologist with a passion to optimize the plant production and to meet the needs of a future world.

Since my undergraduate studies I am enjoying sharing the knowledge I gained from the university with the wider public. To this end I joined with the business magazines, to write articles related to biotechnology, genetically modified organisms and agriculture. I believe scientists need to communicate with business to explain the opportunities our new technologies can provide for them and their customers.
