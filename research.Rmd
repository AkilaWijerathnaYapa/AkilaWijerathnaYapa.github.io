My academic background has imbued me with interest in the interdisciplinary biotechnology research and intersection of science and management. I bring skills in research project proposal formulation and management, scientific and technical writing, statistical data analysis, and key laboratory techniques in Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Molecular biology, and Multi-Omics (Proteomics, Metabolomics, Transcriptomics) to research groups.  


I lead and complete 7 independent research projects and collaborated on 2 projects.

**Independent Projects**

1.	Determining the contribution of autophagy to protein turnover rate of energy organelles in the model plant _Arabidopsis_. _at the University of Western Australia, the Australian National University, the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research_.
2.	Analysis of constitutively active PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE1/ PYR1-LIKE (PYL) receptors in the early development of _Arabidopsis thaliana_. Identifying the function and biological role of abscisic acid receptors beyond hormonal signaling. _at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem._ 
3.	Screening an Arabidopsis cDNA library for interactor proteins of cyclase novel protein responsible for crop abiotic stress tolerance. _at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Weizmann Institute of Science._
4.	Effects of different hormonal concentrations and culture medium on multiplication and rooting of stage II banana _(Musa cavendishii)_. _at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem._
5.	Application of Biotechnology in Intra Cellular Pathogen Diagnostic of Coconut _(Cocos nucifera L.)_ in Sri Lanka. Developed PCR and 2D-PAGE based molecular diagnosis method for CCCVd viroid disease and Phytoplasma. _at Coconut Research Institute Sri Lanka._
6.	Assessment of Inter and Intra Cultivar Genetic and Phenotypic Variation in Grain Quality Characteristics of Sri Lankan Traditional Aromatic Rice _(Oryza Sativa L.)_. _at Rice Research and Development Institute Sri Lanka and the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka._
7.	Exploration of the relationship between fragrant gene and growth performances of fragrant rice _(Oryza sativa L.)_ seedlings under salinity stress. _at Rice Research and Development Institute Sri Lanka and the Wayamba University of Sri Lanka._

**Collaborative Projects**

1.	Discovering the role of autophagic protein turnovers under phosphate deficiency conditions. _at the University of Western Australia._
2.	Unraveling protein turnover under high light and low light stressed conditions. _at the University of Western Australia._
