My academic background has imbued me with interest in the interdisciplinary research and intersection of science and management. Agriculture is a source and a sink of greenhouse gases. Agricultural production becomes geopolitically more important over time due to global warming. Fertile topsoil has disappeared from farms. Drought and erosion are becoming epidemic. Meanwhile, climate change continues to make weather more extreme and unpredictable. These cascading crises put agricultural producers – rural farmers in an increasingly tough position. Hence, it is vital to focus crop science research holistically to understand how the physiology and biology of the crop, agro-climate, soil, and water communicate with each other for resilient crops to climate change. Therefore, I am highly interested to contribute to the agriculture community by enabling developing high-yielding crops (Wheat, Rice, Millet), and supporting to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals — Zero Hunger, Sustainable consumption and production, Climate Action, and Ecosystem management. 

I want to become a leader in sustainable agricultural research and development. Having a background in both agriculture and plant biotechnology, I am looking for the opportunity to apply my extensive scientific and analytical skills to generate new knowledge in applied agriculture and innovations.  

I bring skills in research project proposal formulation and management, scientific and technical writing, statistical data analysis, and key laboratory techniques in Crop Science, Agriculture, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Molecular biology, and Omics (Proteomics, Metabolomics, Transcriptomics) to your research groups. Also, I specialized in the physiology of plant production in controlled environment agriculture. Further, I am keen to engage with a collaborating with the industry and academia. 


I lead and complete 7 independent research projects and collaborated on 2 projects.

**Independent Projects**

2.	Analysis of constitutively active PYRABACTIN RESISTANCE1/ PYR1-LIKE (PYL) receptors in the early development of _Arabidopsis thaliana_. Identifying the function and biological role of abscisic acid receptors beyond hormonal signaling. _at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem._ 
3.	Screening an Arabidopsis cDNA library for interactor proteins of cyclase novel protein responsible for crop abiotic stress tolerance. _at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Weizmann Institute of Science._
4.	Effects of different hormonal concentrations and culture medium on multiplication and rooting of stage II banana _(Musa cavendishii)_. _at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem._
5.	Application of Biotechnology in Intra Cellular Pathogen Diagnostic of Coconut _(Cocos nucifera L.)_ in Sri Lanka. Developed PCR and 2D-PAGE based molecular diagnosis method for CCCVd viroid disease and Phytoplasma. _at Coconut Research Institute Sri Lanka._
